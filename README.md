# School-Drop_out_prediction
Students facing the risk of dropping out of educational institutions require targeted support to improve their chances of success. To address this need, educational institutions require accurate predictive models that can effectively identify students at risk. This project is dedicated to developing and optimizing such predictive models, aiming to accurately forecast student dropout rates. Hence, it seeks to provide actionable recommendations for interventions that can boost student retention and overall success. The ultimate objective is to create a comprehensive framework that enhances institutional strategies for supporting at-risk students and improving educational outcomes.
